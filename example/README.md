This repository is an example of MSW usage based on create-react-app.

## Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

## Configure MSW

```bash
msw create public
```

> We are using "public" as the `rootDir` because CRA serves files from the "public" directory.

## Run

```bash
npm start
```

Edit the `src/mocks.js` and see the mocking in action.
