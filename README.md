## Motivation

### Problems of traditional mocking:

- Often relies on a mocking server which you need to run and maintain;
- Doesn't really mock requests, rather **replaces** requests' urls, so they go to the mocking server, instead of the production server;
- Brings extra dependencies to your application, instead of being a dependency-free development tool;

## Getting started

### Install

```bash
â€“
```

### Configure routes

```js
import { MSW } from 'not-published-yet'

/* Create a new instance of MockServiceWorker */
const msw = new MSW()

/* Configure mocking routes */
msw.get(
  'https://api.github.com/repo/:repoName',
  (req, res, { status, set, delay, json }) => {
    const { repoName } = req.params // acces request's params

    return res(
      status(403), // set custom response status
      set({ 'Custom-Header': 'foo' }), // set headers
      delay(1000), // delay the response
      json({
        errorMessage: `Repository "${repoName}" not found`,
      }),
    )
)

/* Start the Service Worker */
msw.start()
```

## How does this work?

The library spawns a ServiceWorker that broadcasts any outgoing request on a page to the application. The listener then matches the request against the schema of mocking routes, and resolves with the mocked response whenever present.

## Browser support

Please note that this library is meant to be used for **development only**. It doesn't require nor encourage you to install any ServiceWorker on the production environment.
